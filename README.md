# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
This project involves creating an interactive map that displays earthquake data. The map is built using Leaflet, a popular open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. The earthquake data is retrieved from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website, and is displayed on the map using markers that vary in size and color based on the magnitude of each earthquake. The map also includes a layer control that allows users to toggle between different map styles, as well as additional overlays for tectonic plates and major earthquakes. The legend on the bottom right displays the color-coding for earthquake magnitude, and the corresponding range of magnitudes for each color. The project involves using JavaScript, D3, and Leaflet to build the map and customize its features.

### Instructions
- When you first open the map, you will see a default view of the world with earthquake data from the past week.

- You can use the layers control in the top right corner of the map to switch between different base maps (streets, satellite, and dark) and overlay maps (earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes).

- To view details about a particular earthquake, simply click on the earthquake marker. A popup will appear with information about the magnitude and location of the earthquake.

- You can also use the legend control in the bottom right corner of the map to view the color scale and magnitude ranges for the earthquakes on the map.

- If you want to zoom in or out on the map, you can use the zoom control in the top left corner of the map, or you can use your mouse scroll wheel.
